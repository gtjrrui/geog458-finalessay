### Introduction
This project is a dashboard that represents all the statistics and information regarding the COVID-19 Epidemic, ranging from total worldwide confirmed cases, recovered cases, and confirmed deaths. The major functions of the dashboard are that it displays a map of the world with the amount of covid cases for each country, province and state, while also displaying other statistics on the side as well. There are also different tabs for other kinds of information regarding the coronavirus, such as active cases and case-fatality ratios. A lot of interaction can be done with the map, which allows readers to gain further extensive information on the issue, and in their areas of interest. For example, it is possible to see cases by country, and also see cases by each US state by clicking on the map for pop-ups and further information.  

**Information regarding the map:**
* The map of the dashboard is of a bubble map of the COVID-19 cases, where the size of the bubble is dependent on the number of cases for each province.  

* The dashboard has a zooming feature to look at specific regions around the world.

* The map lacks certain map elements, such as a scalar bar and a north arrow, which can affect the reader’s ability to read the map.

The dashboard is most likely intended for an audience who has an academic background related to the COVID-19 epidemic, as it has a lot of information and data regarding the event, and also caters to those who are experienced in reading data and maps. However, despite the focus on an academic audience, it does have enough information that anyone could easily read and interpret. Those who are experienced with data can use the dashboard to gain and extract information regarding the epidemic, and potentially use such information for other types of research, such as comparing the statistics of the coronavirus to other diseases and incidents. The authors of the project are associated with the Johns Hopkins University’s (JHU) Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), and appears to have experience in displaying and collecting data as shown in the dashboard.

### Systematic Architecture

The dashboard has various elements that help display information to the readers, such as a basemap, thematic layer, and interactive elements that show information regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition to the elements, the project also has a database and file server in order for it to function, alongside a web and geospatial server to control the flow of information projected into their dashboard. The data for the dashboard is extracted from other databases related to the coronavirus, which is in turn placed into the dashboard’s own database that displays the necessary information to the map. In order to keep the project up to date, it is most likely updating its own database with the other datasets outside the website to constantly gain new information regarding the subject. A lot of the information regarding the coronavirus is most likely handled server-side, and updates the client-side of the project after gathering all of the necessary information. The major functions of the program is that it separates a lot of the information it extracts from various databases into their respective categories, but at the same time shows all the information in the same place. Specifically, most databases regarding the coronavirus cases may only cater to one country, province, or state, but the dashboard combines all of the information into one place, but also still shows data regarding each specific area. The data for all the countries is well-documented and organized for the project to properly display the necessary information for the audience, and effectively conveying the data regarding the coronavirus.

### Web Mapping Design

The design of the map in the data dashboard supports various features, ranging from interactive elements and responsive designs. Specifically, there is responsive design in the map by being able to interact with the coronavirus statistics for each region, allowing further interaction with the map in addition to the other features of the dashboard. Alongside the elements, the basemap of the project is a standard world map in the Human Geography Dark theme, but it can be changed and modified by the user, allowing the basemap to be other themes, such as OpenStreetMap, and Light Gray Canvas. The thematic layer of the map are the worldwide COVID-19 statistics such as total cases, active cases, recovered, and confirmed deaths. The thematic layers are interchangeable through the interactive elements, as the user has the ability to change out the information displayed on the map and other parts of the project. Other interactive parts of the dashboard also include the ability to zoom in and out of the map, resizing all the windows displaying information, and further changing the displays of certain coronavirus statistics, such as testing sites, global deaths, and global recovered cases. Overall, the data dashboard has an abundant amount of information regarding the topic, and has plenty of elements to properly display the knowledge to the intended audience. However, since the project is intended for an academic audience, it may be difficult for others to understand the various kinds of information that is offered through the various elements of the dashboard. Although it may be difficult to understand for some people, the data dashboard provides sufficient information regarding the epidemic to most readers, and effectively portrays the data in a readable manner to the intended audience.

### Discussion

After fully examining the data dashboard, there are various academic ways that the application can be used for, such as for gathering and visualizing data on specific regions. Although there are many other projects that have does the same tasks, JHU’s data dashboard covers the entire world regarding data on the coronavirus, which very few programs have done. In addition, there are so many ways that the data is shown in the dashboard, so that the same information can be understood in various ways, both in terms of visuals and in terms of numbers. However, there are some drawbacks to the massive amount of data that the dashboard offers to the users, and it may deter some users from viewing the data. Specifically, the amount of data the project shows to a normal user may be too much information to read or understand easily, which may deter them from understanding the data. However, despite the overabundance of information, the data can be used for educational and academic applications, which can be extremely helpful in understanding the epidemic. In addition, the data could be used to further our understanding in other fields as well, such as how a virus will spread, and what countries are most vulnerable to global epidemics. With all the given information, I strongly believe that the benefits that the project has to offer greatly outweighs the drawbacks that exists within the application.

JHU’s Data Dashboard seems to strongly relate to the topic of digital geographies, is the project strongly demonstrates how the digital age has led to the creation of new ways geography can be used with modern technology. Specifically, the digital age has enabled maps to contain and display more information than what can be shown in a traditional map (Ash et al, 30). The new methods of mapmaking and cartography has led to the idea that geography has entered a new era where digital technologies has greatly changed the geographic field. With the ability to make various elements in a map, alongside the ease of implementing such features, the dashboard is a strong example of what can be done with today’s technology in the field of geography. In addition to digital geographies, the project also shows ideas of geovisualization, as it shows the numerous ways that geographic information can be portrayed online. Specifically, it was noted in the readings that geovisuals should go beyond just simply showing the phenomenon, but also to find ways to inform readers of the subject by appealing to their need to further investigate and examine the topic provided by the map (Aitken & Craine, 279). The map does show various ways in portraying the information to appeal to readers to look into the COVID-19 epidemic by showing the data in both visualizations and statistics. With the project’s relation to the two topics, it shows how the map is effective in delving into the subject of the coronavirus, and demonstrates how well it uses today’s technology in portraying such subject.

### Conclusion

Although the application examines an issue that is currently being covered by many other websites and applications, I believe that the COVID-19 Data Dashboard from John Hopkins University covers the most information regarding the epidemic. Alongside its various features and interactivity, what the program has to offer is most likely the most detailed, and has data on a global scale regarding the cases and deaths related to the coronavirus. How the data is portrayed through the web mapping design helps most academic readers understand the information easily, which benefits those who seek to use the data for other purposes. As a result, JHU’s dashboard is effective in covering the COVID-19 epidemic and provides the most information regarding the subject.
